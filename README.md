<h1>🧠 Overview</h1>
Tower of Hanoi is a classic algorithmic puzzle involving the movement of disks between rods. This project animates the solution using recursion and DOM manipulation

<h1>🧩 How It Works</h1>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Recursively move n - 1 disks to the auxiliary rod</li>
<li>Move the nth (largest) disk to the destination rod</li>
<li>Recursively move n - 1 disks from auxiliary to destination</li>
</ol>
This is visualized step-by-step in the animation above.</p>
